		<p>In the November of 2019, I decided to build a weather app in my mission to learn mobile app development. After countless nights of trial and error in my attempt to learn Java, I decided to make things easier for myself and delved into Flutter. Flutter's simple scaffolding implementation allowed me to build a fairly versatile app in the matter of days.</p>
