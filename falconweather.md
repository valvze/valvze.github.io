			<h2>What is this?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>In the November of 2019, I decided to build a weather app in my mission to learn mobile app development. After countless nights of trial and error in my attempt to learn Java, I decided to make things easier for myself and delved into Flutter. Flutter's simple scaffolding implementation allowed me to build a fairly versatile app in the matter of days.</p>
		<p>Powered by Dark Sky, Weather by Falcon is a reliable source of weather information and is a joy to use with it's beautiful user interface. Try it for yourself by clicking this <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parthshah.falcon_weather&hl=en&gl=US">link</a>.</p>

					<h3>Function and Form</h3>
				</header>
				<p>While developing Falcon, a key focus was keeping it simple and beautiful while also presenting the most valuable information to plan your day. Form over function or function over form? I say why not both!</p>

					<h3>Cool Features</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I didn't want to produce a weather app for the sake of learning development; I also cared about making something functional that people could use reliably every day of their life. As a result, I added nice QoL features such as a dark mode and a dynamic coloring system.</p>

					<h3>But Also the Ones You Need!</h3>
				</header>
				<p>But what good is dark mode if the app isn't accurate? To produce a reliable app, I have implemented APIs from AirVisual, Google, and most importantly: Dark Sky. This will ensure that whatever your seeing on screen corresponds to what you're sensing outside. Amazing!</p>
